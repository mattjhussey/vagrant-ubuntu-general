# vagrant-ubuntu-general
IAC for a general purpose Ubuntu Desktop

## Installing
Initial installation can be triggered using `vagrant up`

VB Guest Additions do not automatically install. The vagrant-vbguest plugin has been discontinued and hangs during install.
For now manually running guest additions seems the simplest approach.
